A lightweight GUI app written in Java using Java Swing to make a real-time automated bot for retrieving university schedules, which are stored in JSON files, based on user prompts. The bot receives and replies to the user via email using IMAP4, POP3, and SMTP protocols. The user can send complex prompts with many options like date, time, and name. The app can view the received prompts and put their information, like sender email, date & time, and prompt text, in the specific fields.
